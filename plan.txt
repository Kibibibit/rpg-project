Lets try a state stack now.
States are objects, that then push new states to the queue



Battle System:
	- On round start, each combatant is placed in order based on intiative (currently speed)
	- if a character hits an enemy weakness, or lands a critical hit, the target is knocked down. Characters
	  who have been knocked down are moved to the end of the initiative order.
	- If a character lands a knockdown, they start a chain, and gain one Momentum
		- The next allied character in the intiative order gets their turned moved up to be next
		- The character can either spend the Momentum to use a more powerful version of one of their skills, 
		  or try to continue the chain
		- If all party members participate in the chain, some kind of special thing could happen?
		- Failing to score a knockdown will break the chain, or if an aoe attack hits an enemy resistance/reflect/absorb
		- You cannot chain to someone who has already had their turn (Chaining doesn't give an extra turn,
		it just makes a charater have their turn sooner)
